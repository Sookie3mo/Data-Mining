//hw1-README

Create a "hw1" directory under the spark-2.1.0-bin-hadoop2.7 dirrectory
(Just copy the directory I submitted under spark-2.1.0-bin-hadoop2.7

Those files are under the "hw1" directory:
"ratings.csv"
"ratings_large.csv"
"tags.csv"
"tags_large.csv"
"Yiming_Liu.jar"  //I packed four scala classes together into this jar.

Run Yiming_Liu.jar under "spark-2.1.0-bin-hadoop2.7" using command lines below:

bin/spark-submit --class Task1  hw1/Yiming_Liu.jar
bin/spark-submit --class Task1Large  hw1/Yiming_Liu.jar
bin/spark-submit --class Task2  hw1/Yiming_Liu.jar
bin/spark-submit --class Task2Large  hw1/Yiming_Liu.jar //This one may run about 10mins.

Then, the results could be found under "hw1‚Äù.
